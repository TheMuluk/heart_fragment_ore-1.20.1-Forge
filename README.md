# Heart Fragment Ore

**Heart Fragment Ore** is a small add-on that extends **Legendary Survival Overhaul** by introducing a new ore in both normal and deepslate variants. These ores drop **Heart Fragments**, allowing players to obtain them naturally through mining instead of only through existing LSO mechanics.

The add-on is designed to integrate seamlessly with LSO’s progression-focused survival system and remains lightweight and balanced.
